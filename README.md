Built with tests first (bulletproof reliability)
No over-engineering (only what's needed)
Production-ready from day one
Easy to add new features

a complete, battle-tested chat system that you can deploy today and start building your chat application on top of. The foundation is solid, tested, and ready to scale.



after finising the this task what are things i can expect from this system 


after this we are going to do a after db setup test, redis setup test, socket setu test and so on
then we are doign the coversation like 1-1 1-busines, group something like that

test case pass
actual minimal inplementation also pass 
we are goiong to be sure that everthing works and we make a solid foundation and we can start building chat application on top of it (the actual system)

we also have the route and response like that things right


we are going to make a sequence/oder to what to do and test that thing we are not goiing to do the furtuhur without completely make that thing work
main thing is sequence/order that should be thooughtful we need make this such way so easly testable incremental (i dont know what is going be that  i just give what my instinc say  your tassk is to figureout that)
