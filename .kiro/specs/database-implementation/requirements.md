# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete database migration from static JSON files to a normalized, optimized MySQL/PostgreSQL database while maintaining 100% API compatibility. The system currently uses 8 JSON files as data sources and needs to transition to a proper relational database without any changes to the frontend application or API contracts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from JSON files to a proper database, so that the system can handle concurrent users, ensure data integrity, and improve performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database migration is complete THEN all existing API endpoints SHALL return identical responses to current JSON-based responses
2. WHEN multiple users access the system simultaneously THEN the database SHALL handle concurrent operations without data corruption
3. WHEN any CRUD operation is performed THEN the database SHALL maintain referential integrity and data consistency
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN database queries SHALL perform significantly better than JSON file operations
5. IF any API endpoint is called with existing parameters THEN the response format SHALL be identical to the current implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema to be properly normalized and optimized, so that data redundancy is eliminated and query performance is maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database schema is implemented THEN it SHALL follow 3NF normalization principles
2. WHEN complex queries are executed THEN proper indexes SHALL ensure optimal performance
3. WHEN related data is queried THEN foreign key relationships SHALL maintain data integrity
4. WHEN calculated fields are needed THEN computed columns SHALL provide real-time calculations
5. IF data relationships exist THEN they SHALL be properly modeled with appropriate constraints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want all existing API calls to work without modification, so that no frontend code changes are required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any existing API endpoint is called THEN the response structure SHALL be identical to current JSON responses
2. WHEN pagination parameters are used THEN they SHALL work exactly as before
3. WHEN filtering or search parameters are applied THEN they SHALL produce identical results
4. WHEN nested data is requested THEN it SHALL be properly assembled from normalized tables
5. IF any API contract exists THEN it SHALL be preserved completely

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a safe migration process with rollback capability, so that the system can be restored if issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration begins THEN all existing JSON data SHALL be backed up
2. WHEN each migration step completes THEN data integrity SHALL be verified
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN comprehensive testing SHALL validate all functionality
4. WHEN issues are detected THEN a rollback process SHALL restore the previous state
5. IF migration fails at any step THEN the system SHALL remain in a consistent state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want proper database security and performance monitoring, so that the system is secure and performs optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is deployed THEN proper access controls SHALL be implemented
2. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN it SHALL be properly protected
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL be logged for audit purposes
4. WHEN performance issues arise THEN monitoring SHALL detect and alert administrators
5. IF security threats are detected THEN appropriate protections SHALL be in place

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business user, I want all existing functionality to work seamlessly after migration, so that daily operations are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN students are managed THEN all CRUD operations SHALL work identically
2. WHEN invoices are generated THEN the billing process SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN payments are recorded THEN financial calculations SHALL be accurate
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL contain the same data and format
5. IF any business process exists THEN it SHALL continue to function without modification

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the database to support future scalability and feature additions, so that the system can grow with business needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is designed THEN it SHALL support horizontal and vertical scaling
2. WHEN new features are added THEN the schema SHALL accommodate extensions
3. WHEN data volume grows THEN performance SHALL remain acceptable
4. WHEN concurrent users increase THEN the system SHALL handle the load
5. IF future integrations are needed THEN the database SHALL support them

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing to ensure the migration is successful, so that all functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration testing begins THEN all existing test cases SHALL pass
2. WHEN API endpoints are tested THEN responses SHALL match exactly
3. WHEN data integrity is verified THEN all relationships SHALL be correct
4. WHEN performance is tested THEN it SHALL meet or exceed current performance
5. IF any discrepancies are found THEN they SHALL be resolved befor
